The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer books. An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a [finite list](data/p7.txt) of well-defined instructions for calculating a [function](data/p8.txt). Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as [randomized algorithms](data/p2.txt), incorporate random input.
Computer Science (abbreviated CS or CompSci) is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. It is the systematic study of the [feasibility](data/p0.txt), structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical processes (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information news, whether such information is encoded as bits in a [computer memory](data/p8.txt) or transcribed in genes and protein structures in a human cell.
