An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a [finite list](data/p0.txt) of well-defined instructions for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a [finite number](data/p7.txt) of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as [randomized algorithms](data/p9.txt), incorporate random input.
Computer Science (abbreviated CS or CompSci) is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. The start of the "digital revolution", which includes the current Information Age and the Internet. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, books, and mechanization of the methodical processes (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information, whether such information is encoded as bits in a [computer memory](data/p0.txt) or transcribed in genes and protein structures in a human cell.
