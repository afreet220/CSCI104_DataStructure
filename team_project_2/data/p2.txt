An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing output and car terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input news.
Computer Science education (abbreviated CompSci) is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical processes or algorithms that underlie the acquisition, processing, storage, books,communication of, and access to information, whether such information is encoded as bits in a computer memory or transcribed in genes and protein structures in a human cell.
