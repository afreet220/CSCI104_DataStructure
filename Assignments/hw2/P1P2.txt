P1:

(a) 1

(b) "make clean" will remove all the .0 files in folder
    "rm -f $(ODIR)/*.o *~ shape1 shape2 $(IDIR)/*~" will be executed
    "make shape1" will try to use the associated files to compile shape1.exe 
    "$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)" will be executed

(c) In terms of Make, a phony target is a target that is always out-of-date, so it will
    always run no matter the state of the file system, even if there's a file named "clean"
    in the directory

(d) 2, 4

P2:

(a) unmodified

(b) README:Modified, has changes not staged
    Funprob:Untracked, has changes not staged 

(c) README:changes Staged
    Funprob:changes Staged

(d) both Modified, has changes not staged

(e) README:changes staged
    Funprob:unmodified
    Content of fun_prob is empty because this command discard local changes to that file to the state of last commit 

(f) README:Modified, has both changes staged and not staged
    Becuase the change before last add is staged, the change after last add is not staged
